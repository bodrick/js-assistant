# Your helper for writing modern, clean and concise code

The P42 JavaScript Assistant adds **[68 automated refactorings and code actions](https://p42.ai/documentation/code-action) for JavaScript, TypeScript, and React** to Visual Studio Code.

The available actions depend on the cursor position, the selected text (if any), the source code, the language type, and any available type information. You can find them in the **quick fix and refactoring context menus**. [Learn more about the editor integration…](https://p42.ai//documentation/p42-for-vscode/editor-integration)

**Underlines with three dots** indicate [suggested refactorings](https://p42.ai///documentation/p42-for-vscode/editor-integration#refactoring-suggestions) that you can perform. The dedicated [refactoring suggestion sidebar](https://p42.ai//documentation/p42-for-vscode/suggestion-sidebar) shows such beneficial refactorings for your whole file.
